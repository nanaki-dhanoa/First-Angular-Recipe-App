# RecepieApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Description

This Web App allows you to create a Recipe Index, where you can Index all your favourite recipes, add their ingredients, which can then be moved to a Shopping Cart through the click of one button. You can also add an Image for the recipe and the procedure to make it. All the recipes are then stored in a Firebase database, and you can view all the recipes either in a condensed mode on the side, or expand each each recipe by clicking on that recipe. 

I have also created a login page, to authenticate the user and display their corresponding recipes.
